The sets of scripts here are essentially similar - those with a 2 or 3 at the end of their name represent notable changes in the function of that particular section. If a script file has no number (i.e. '2', '3') then the default non-nunmbered files are used in combination with those numbered ones.
The main changes are:
'2' = the addition of 'half-way' waypoints / routes to make routes, not as the 'crow flies' but more representative of the actual walking routes. This the estimation of time a user will take to walk that route is more accurate. 

'3' = some error fixes in '2' - but mainly the addition of multi-track for song Stella in Scene 5/6/7.
