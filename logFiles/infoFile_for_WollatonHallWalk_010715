Outward5 
1-	track1/MitaDelMundo: 
    a.	no issues, some effective adaptations
2-	track2/SisterCities:
    a.	transition positioned well and smooth
    b.	Waypoint leading up to pedestrian crossing (PC_A) was too soon before arriving at crossing.
    c.	Volume commands on stems went through 3 fluctuations prior to crossing the road (i.e. down / up / down / up / down/up and then when I crossed they stayed down as desired.
    d.	There is an issue with the stems I’m choosing to lower the volume on here, as on this occasion the song played a section that only uses the stems that have been set to ‘0’, so track went silent for a short time (need addressing)
3-	track3/NotAlone:
    a.	effective transition, although a little late down into Harrow Road (bring waypoint forward a little)
    b.	Long volume fade on R2 during track3/NotAlone was effective
    c.	Some minor audio glitches
4-	track4/Stella:
    a.	waypoint needs re-positioning as the transition occurred too soon, as track started some distance from gate (re-position this waypoint).
    b.	Some effective adaptations, but also some jerky ones. Need to look at segment positions
    c.	Volume commands on stems worked well (R2)
5-	transition:
    a.	Fade out on track4/Stella worked well, but track5/TheBadGuys did not enter.
6-	track5/TheBadGuys:
    a.	Track did not enter continued to walk and nothing happened. Looked at Status which said that “R1”: “DA_HW-DA_TR” was nearest. Walked back and re-selected track4/Stella, which did not start, walked forward again and manually selected track5/TheBadGuys which started playing.
7-	track6/WaitingForGA
    a.	Good transition from previous track to this one.
    b.	regular audio glitches
    c.	some effective adaptations
8-	WollatonArrival:
    a.	Good transition, although fade too quick, needs extending further
    b.	Level of string melody (arrival_layer3a/3b) very low volume in mix (needs addressing)
9-	WollatonArrived:
    a.	No issues
10-	fixedPlayList:
    a.	no issues
