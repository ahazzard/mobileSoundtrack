This infoFile charts two journeys - the outward and inward versions. Walks took place on 28/06/15

outward journey (Jubilee Campus to Wollaton Hall):
1- track1/MitaDelMundo: worked well, apart from a few glitches, which has been happening for some time. Some effective adaptations took place.
2- transition into track2/SisterCities was slightly late in position, but smooth.
3- SisiterCities: some effective adaptions. The volume commands for ‘R2' (crossing the pedestrian crossing) did not work. Furthermore, the track faded out to end, without any adaption to extend its length whilst I was located in the centre of the pedestrian crossing. Just resulted in silence until the next scene initiated.
4- Transition into track3/NotAlone (previous track had finished), but Not Alone faded in on cue.
5- track3/NotAlone had some effective adaptions. The fade out on across route 2 did not take place at first. I doubled back to the start of that route and then it started to fade, then I turned around and walked back and the volume jumped up to full.
6- Transition into track 4/Stella did not take place once inside the gate of Digby Av. continued to walk for a little while and track3/Not Alone continued to play. Then selected track4/Stella manually and the track started.
7- track4/Stella: some effective adaptions. The multi-track volume commands did not work when I approached R2, tried walking back a little and then the silent stems (rhythm track) entered, but quickly disappeared again. Continued to walk on the route and these stems fluctuated in and out 5-6 times.
8- transition into track5/TheBadGuys worked well. Some effective adaptions on route.
9- the transition into track6/WaitingForGA worked well: some effective adaptations on route.
10- the transition into the WollatonHallArrival music was on cue. As with many of the cross-fades, they are not smooth / linear, they jump in and out, particularly the long fades. They start to fade, but then just suddenly cut out.
11- the whole of the arrival / approach to Wollaton Hall worked well an was effective (need to re-export WollatonHallArriveB audio file to have a cleaner impact / accent)
12- The transition into the fixed playlist did not work, selected track manually and it then started.

Inward journey (Wollaton Hall to Jubilee campus):
1- Approach to Wollaton hall worked well (although with a jumpy fade in).
2- tranisiton from Wollaton Hall music into track1/WaitingForGA worked well.
3- track1/WaitingForGA was effective.
4- traniston from track1 to track2/TheBadGuys happened on cue, but a sudden change in musical feel, need to address somehow.
5- track2/TheBadGuys adapted and then reached the end, but no transition into track3/Stella took place. Manually selected the track and it started playing.
6- transition from track3/Stella into track4/MitaDelMundo was smooth and effective.
7- track4/MitaDelMundo had some effective adaptations on route.
8- transition from track4 to track5/SisterCities was late but smooth when it occured (possible reposition of the waypoint here)
9- As on outward journey, no volume adjustment took place at the pedestrian crossing, but adaptations were effective on route.
10- transition from track4/SisterCities to track5/NotAlone was jumbled. Came in late, then Not Alone started, sister cities started to fade, then quickly some of the multi-track stems disappeared briefly leaving two stems (acoustic and keys) playing for a second or two before stopping - FIXED
11- track5/NotAlone: some effective adaptions.
12- None of the transitions into the Atrium arrival music worked, but when selected manually all came in.

key issues:
1- those scenes that do not transition automatically (where manual selection does then initiate) - suggests an issue with the ‘Start/any’ scene that checks which route is nearest.
2- volume fades not smooth and linear. Is the problem the 'sceneTime<2' so when the scene time gets passed ‘2’ it then suddenly steps the volume up or down to the default level?
3- other volume adjustments on multi-routes / multi-track scenes (i.e. SisterCities on both outward and inward journeys and NotAlone on outward). Not currently working.
4- For some transitions it would be nice to fade out the currently playing track, but delay slightly the initiation of the next track. So rather than having a crossfade, there is a slight pause in between one ending and the next starting. This could be achieved by placing a period of silence on the music file, but is this better achieved using ‘file pos’ and ‘track pos’?
5- Getting regular loss of GPS. We spoke about placing in some script that meant there would not be any intervention if GPS was lost until a set time had passed (e.g. 20 secs), to stop the music skipping in and out constantly. This has not been added in yet.
