Notes from the Jubilee Campus to Wollaton Hall test walk on 18/06/15

1:  rather than starting with the holding music and Mita Del Mundo, the app picked up scene 'end' which fades the fixed playlist out on conclusion of the walk. Reloaded app and it commenced with scene 1 / track 1
2:  All tracks now started at the beiginning
3:  GPS was lost many times - Jubilee camous - by the pedestrian crossing - half-way along Harrow Road - On Digby Av in Wollaton hall (half-way up, under tree cover - at top of hill between Digby av and Lime Tree Av. and when in front of Wollaton Hall
4:  The adjusted duration of fades are not working??? adjusting the wrong parameter?
5:  Mita Del Mundo - lots of glitches as previously - no apprent adaptations.
5:  Sister Cities - need to work on the transition to the reduced multi-track arrangement when using the pedestrian crossing. The track is nearly always close to its end, so the crossing scene is not able to prolong it.
^:  Not Alone = good
5:  The tranistion from StellaA (intro loop) to StellaB (verse 1) was unexpected, StellaB started at the intro rather verse 1
6:  The Bad Guys = good
7:  Waiting for GA = good
8:  Wollaton hall arrival music = generally good. start music earlier - put in extra layers for build up.
