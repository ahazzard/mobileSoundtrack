    "_JC-WH_tracksWithoutSections.json",
    "_JC-WH_Stella_splitTrackSections.json",
    "_JC-WH_TheBadGuys_trackSections.json",
    "_JC-WH_MitaDelMundo_trackSections.json",

    "_JC-WH_contextAll2.json",
    "_JC-WH_adaptive_sceneOut2.json",
    "_JC-WH_startOut2.json"
    
    The merge file (that loads all the scripts was:
    
    JC-WH_compOut2.json
    
    The log file is complied from two logs, the second covers the last quater of the walk (not sure why they are split into two?)
